### 📚 About Me
- 🎓 EEE student at **NMAMIT, Nitte**
- 💡 I’m endlessly curious — dabbling in **programming**, **drawing**, **graphics**, **animation**, and everything in between
- 🌱 Still learning the ropes in:
  - ⚙️ Kotlin & Android dev  
  - 🎨 UI/UX Design  
  - 🐍 Advanced Python  
  - 💻 Clean Web Dev using Flask + JS
- 👨‍🚀 Long-term goal? Build awesome projects that blend **tech + creativity**
